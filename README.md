# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
### Project Overview 

This repository contains the data, SQL scripts, Power BI dashboard files, and analysis documentation for the Pizza Sales Analysis project. The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into pizza sales performance using SQL and Power BI. 
The analysis covers key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, pizza sales, order trends, and pizza category breakdowns.

# Objectives
1 Analyze Key Performance Metrics: Calculate and visualize total revenue, total orders, total pizzas sold, and average order value to measure overall sales performance.

2 Category Performance Analysis: Evaluate the percentage of sales contribution by pizza category to identify popular categories and potential areas for improvement.

3 Trend Identification: Track monthly order trends to identify peak and low sales periods for better sales forecasting and seasonal planning.

4 Top Product Insights: Identify the top five pizzas by revenue and quantity sold to guide promotional strategies and inventory prioritization.

5 Dashboard Development: Build a Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to interact with and visualize key sales data for easy interpretation and decision-making.
# Data Sources
The dataset for this project contains information about pizza sales, including: The data set is from kaggle.com

-Order ID

-Pizza name   -Pizza category    -Quantity     -Price    -Order date

The dataset was imported into SQL for analysis and then exported to Power BI for visualization.

#Skills Demonstrated
SQL: Efficient data extraction, aggregation, and calculation of KPIs.
Data Visualization: Power BI dashboard creation with interactive visuals for trends and KPIs.
Data Analysis: Identifying sales drivers and trends, and analyzing category performance.
Business Intelligence: Translating raw data into actionable insights for better decision-making.
